# Utils 

## Overview

The `utils` folder in a React Native application plays a crucial role in maintaining reusable utility functions, services, and helper modules. This documentation outlines the structure, extension, and usage of the `utils` folder, ensuring a streamlined approach to utility management.

## Folder Structure

### `default` Index File
- The index file in the `utils` folder serves as a central export point for all utility modules.
- It simplifies the import process by allowing multiple utilities to be imported from a single source.

### Utility Modules
- Each utility module within the folder is either a set of functions, a service, or a helper class.
- Examples include token management (`AccessToken`), camera functionalities (`Camera`), and local storage operations (`Storage`).

## Example: Utility Modules

### `AccessToken`
- Manages access token operations like fetching, storing, and validating tokens.

### `Camera`
- Provides functionalities related to camera operations within the application.

### `Storage`
- Handles local storage operations, such as saving and retrieving data.

## Extension

### Adding New Utilities
- To introduce new utility functions or services, create a new file or folder in the `utils` directory.
- Implement the utility logic and export the necessary functions, services, or classes.
- Update the index file to include exports from the new utility module.

### Modifying Existing Utilities
- Open the relevant utility file or folder.
- Implement the required changes or additions.
- These changes will be automatically available wherever the utility is imported via the index file.

## Usage

### Importing Utilities
- Utilities are imported directly from the `utils` index file.
- This approach ensures a consistent and organized way to access utility functions throughout the application.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  import { Storage, AccessToken, Camera } from 'path/to/utils';

  // Usage
  const token = AccessToken.get();
  Storage.store('key', 'value');
  Camera.openCamera();
  ```

## Best Practices

- **Modular Design**: Design utility modules to be self-contained and independent.
- **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear and meaningful names for utility files and their exported members.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure each utility module or function has a single, well-defined purpose.

Adhering to these best practices will enhance the maintainability and scalability of the application's utility layer, promoting a clean and efficient codebase.
