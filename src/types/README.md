# Types Folder Documentation

## Overview

The `types` folder in a React Native application is dedicated to storing TypeScript type definitions and interfaces. This folder plays a crucial role in maintaining type safety and clarity across the application. The types are organized based on domain and common interfaces, with all of them being exported through a central index file.

## Folder Structure

- **Domain-Based Types**: Types are categorized based on specific domains or functionalities of the application, such as navigation, state management, and models.

- **Common Interfaces**: General interfaces that are used across different parts of the application are stored here. These could include types for common data models, utility functions, or custom hooks.

- **Index File**: This file exports all the types and interfaces from the folder, allowing for easy and organized importing throughout the application.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Domain-Based Types

Each domain or feature of the application has its own file for relevant type definitions. For example:

- **Navigation Types** (`NavigationTypes.ts`): Types related to navigation, such as parameter lists for different navigators.
- **State Management Types** (`StateTypes.ts`): Types for global state management, such as actions, state structures, and selectors.
- **Post Types** (`postTypes.ts`): Interfaces and types for data used within feed posts.

### Common Interfaces

Common interfaces are defined in files like:

- **Common Types** (`commonInterfaces.ts`): General interfaces that might be used in multiple areas of the application.

### Index File

The index file (`index.ts`) in the `types` folder exports all the defined types and interfaces:

```typescript
export * from './navigationTypes';
export * from './postTypes';
export * from './commonTypes';
```

## Usage

To use the types in your application, import them from the `types` folder:

```typescript
import { SomeNavigationType, SomeCommonType } from 'path/to/types';
```

## Best Practices

- **Organized Structure**: Maintain a clear structure for type definitions, separating them based on domain and functionality.
- **Descriptive Naming**: Use descriptive and clear naming for type and interface files.
- **Centralized Exports**: Utilize the index file to export all types, ensuring a clean and organized import process across the application.

This approach to organizing types ensures scalability, maintainability, and a clear understanding of where and how types are defined and used in the project.
