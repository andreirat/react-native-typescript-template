This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open the project in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

## Scripts


### `rm:pods`
- **Command**: `rm -rf ios/Pods && rm -rf ios/Podfile.lock`
- **Description**: Removes the iOS Pods directory and the Podfile lock file, often used to resolve issues with iOS dependencies.

### `rm:modules`
- **Command**: `rm -rf node_modules/ && rm -rf yarn.lock`
- **Description**: Removes the `node_modules` directory and the Yarn lock file to facilitate a clean installation of dependencies.

### `rm:lock-files`
- **Command**: `rm -rf yarn.lock && rm -rf ios/Podfile.lock`
- **Description**: Removes both the Yarn lock file and the iOS Podfile lock file.

### `install:pods`
- **Command**: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
- **Description**: Navigates to the iOS directory, runs `pod install` to install CocoaPods dependencies for iOS, and then returns to the root directory.

## Usage

To run any of these scripts, use the `yarn` or `npm` command-line interface. For example, to start the Metro bundler, you would run:

```bash
yarn rm:pods
```

## Best Practices

- Regularly use `lint` to maintain code quality.
- Use the `rm:pods` and `rm:modules` scripts to troubleshoot and resolve dependency-related issues.
- Ensure that the environment is correctly set up for running `ios` and `android` scripts, particularly with respect to emulators and simulators.
